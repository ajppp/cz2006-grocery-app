# cz2006-grocery-app
Coursework for CZ2006: Software Engineering done in AY20/21 Semester 2

Our project is called **Minimising Food Waste by Leveraging Technology**. To that end, our group will develop an Android app that allows users to keep track of their groceries and shopping list. The app will also allow users to keep track of expiry dates and food restrictions. The app can be downloaded and built using Android Studio and it was built using Kotlin.
